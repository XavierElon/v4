Hello! I'm Xavier Elon, a software engineer and electrical engineer student based in Orlando, FL who has a passion for space and renewable engergy. I am currently interning for Vision 13, a company that is building an artificial intelligent neural network stock trading application. I also run my own successful property management company so I have strong business skills alongside my engineering passions.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/)(with an expected grad. date of June 2020) and Electrical Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu/). I am currently a Artificial Intelligence Software Engineer intern for a comapny called Vision13.
