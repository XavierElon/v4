Hello! I'm Xavier Elon, a software engineer and electrical engineering  student based in Orlando, FL who has a passion for technology and space. I run my own successful property management company so I have strong business skills alongside my engineering passions.

I have my own YouTube Channel where I discuss algorithms and solutions located [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzn_i33n79ljur943FlMqw). I also run and manage a 1000+ member slack channel dedicated to discussing daily LeetCode solutions. The invite link can be found [here!](https://join.slack.com/t/xavierelonleetcode/shared_invite/enQtOTc1NTkwOTU4NDk2LTg3NmU2NzYxN2Y2N2I5MWY2NzFkN2U3NmI2YmRlMDFmNDdmZDNhYzAyMWJmMjQ4NWI5OTYyYmU4YTEyNTMwYTU)

I'm currently studying Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) (with an expected grad. date of June 2020) and Electrical Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu/). I am currently working on a full-stack MERN web application that can be found at http://3.19.11.4:8080/
