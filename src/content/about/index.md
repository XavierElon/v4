Hello! I'm Xavier Elon, a Computer Science graduate and electrical engineering student based in Orlando, FL who has a passion for technology and space. I run my own successful property management company so I have strong business skills alongside my engineering passions.

I have my own YouTube Channel where I discuss algorithms and solutions located [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzn_i33n79ljur943FlMqw). I also run and manage a 1000+ member slack channel dedicated to discussing daily LeetCode solutions.

I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu/). I have my bachelor's in Computer Science from Oregon State University. I am currently working on a full-stack MERN web application that can be found at http://ratemyclasses.io
