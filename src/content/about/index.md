Hello! I'm Xavier Elon, a Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University based in Orlando, FL who has a passion for technology and space. I am currently working for Asurion/UBreakiFix as a DevOps Engineer 1

I run my own successful property management company which has allowed me to develop strong business and people skills alongside my engineering passions.

I have my own YouTube Channel where I discuss algorithms and solutions located [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzn_i33n79ljur943FlMqw). I also run and manage a 1000+ member slack channel dedicated to discussing daily LeetCode solutions.

I am currently working on a full-stack MERN web application that can be found at http://ratemyclasses.io (among other projects).
